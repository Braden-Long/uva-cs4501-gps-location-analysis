# GPS Location Analysis Project Summary

## Overview
This project analyzed GPS location data to identify significant locations that users frequently visit. 
The analysis included:
- Loading and preprocessing GPS data from multiple users
- Selecting users with the best data quality
- Clustering GPS coordinates to identify significant locations
- Analyzing temporal patterns of visits
- Integrating with Google Places API to label location types
- Evaluating the accuracy of the classification
- Creating visualizations and reports of the findings

## Methodology

### 1. Data Selection
Users were evaluated based on:
- Number of GPS records
- Date range covered
- Variety of locations visited
- Mix of stationary and moving points

### 2. Significant Location Identification
- DBSCAN clustering algorithm was used to group nearby GPS points
- Parameters: 
  - eps=0.0005 (approximately 50 meters)
  - min_samples=5 (minimum points to form a cluster)
  - min_duration_minutes=10 (minimum time spent at location)

### 3. Location Classification
Locations were classified using:
- Place types from Google Places API
- Temporal patterns (time of day, day of week)
- Visit duration and frequency

### 4. Visualization
- Interactive maps with Folium
- Temporal heatmaps of visits
- Distribution charts of location types

## Results Summary

### User 59
- Total significant locations identified: 25

### User 12
- Total significant locations identified: 35

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how GPS data can be effectively used to identify and classify important locations in a person's life. 
The combination of spatial clustering, temporal analysis, and integration with place data provides a comprehensive picture of 
mobility patterns and routine behaviors.

## Future Improvements
- Use labeled ground truth data to improve classification accuracy
- Implement trajectory analysis to understand movement patterns between locations
- Analyze changes in routines over time
- Include more contextual data (weather, events, etc.) to enrich the analysis
